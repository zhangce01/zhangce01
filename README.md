- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zhangce01
- Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Master's degree in Machine Learning at CMU and looking forward to graduating in December 2024. Before this, I earned my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). My current research interest lie in vision-language models and scene understanding.
