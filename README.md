- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zhangce01
- Iâ€™m currently a research intern at Tencent AI Lab. I will be joining the Ph.D. in Robotics program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Fall 2025. Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. in Machine Learning in the Machine Learning Department at CMU, advised by Prof. Katia Sycara. Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Zhihai He. My current research interest lie in vision-language models and scene understanding.
